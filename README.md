# PS3NeuralNetHousePrice

# attempted multiple large and small learning rates, but this did not improve the result -- I expect to see that both the training and the test rmse should decrease if the model is making better predictions 
# Larger epochs does not improve the result 
# Smaller epochs does not improve the result 


# The best code that ran is Deep_NeuralNetHousePrice.ipynb which yields Training RMSE: 20561.171172868533
# Test RMSE: 35737.116615642066
